First of all, this is a guide for MacOS users. I'm sorry, but I am physically unable to create a manual for other operating systems.

**Disclamer** – I hope you know what [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is.

## First step
We have to install coq on our machine. Best way to do it – [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/). 
I didn't even know about it until I had to contact Coq, btw.


Let's install it.
```asm
brew install opam
```

## Second step

Getting the Coq (not funny).
```asm
opam install coq
```

## Third step
Coq code writing environment.
We have several options here. 
  - The first is [CoqIDE](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/practical-tools/coqide.html), a terrible choice, we won't make it.
  - The second is [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and its [ProofGeneral](https://proofgeneral.github.io/). Not a bad choice, we'll look at how to set it up.
  - Final one is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and its [VSCoq](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maximedenes.vscoq). Good one too.

My personal choice is Visual Studio Code.

### Let's start with Emacs.

- `brew install emacs` - Install.
- `touch ~/.emacs` - Create a configuration file.
- `vi ~/.emacs` - Open configuration file.
- Paste this
  ```asm
  (load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG/generic/proof-site")
  (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/usr/local/bin")))
                          # here you just have to call `which coqtop` and get the path.
  (custom-set-variables '(coq-prog-name "PATH/TO/coqtop") '(proof-three-window-enable t))
  ```
 - Google.com to find out how to get out of VIM.
 - Restart a terminal.

You're ready to go.

### Visual Studio Code

  - [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Visual Studio Code
  - [Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maximedenes.vscoq) VSCoq plugin
  - Execute `which coqctop` and copy the path without `/coqtop` at the end of the path.
  - Open settings of VSCode and set `"coqtop.binPath": "path/from/previos/step",`
  - Restart the VSCode.

You're ready to go

### Congrats!

Now you can be that guy.
