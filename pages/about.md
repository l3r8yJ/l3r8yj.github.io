I'm Ivan Ivanchuck(Russian: Иван Иванчук), aspiring software developer.

Well, as a software developer, I _have to write code_, and I [write](https://github.com/l3r8yJ). As you can see I write preferably in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), sometimes in [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)). Also in [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)), but so far my knowledge is too small to say that I am a Rust programmer. Also you can check out my [work enviroment](/2023/02/21/my-work-environment).

My main activity is contributing to open source projects: [**Objectionary**](https://github.com/objectionary), [**EO-CQRS**](https://github.com/eo-cqrs). Also have [my own](/pets/). Perhaps you will also find them interesting. Therefore, you are always welcome to send pull request!
<br/>

I study at the university. I'm majoring in software engineering.

Why l3r8y? It's just leroy, but it's rough, why leroy? 
I find [this old video funny](https://youtu.be/mLyOj_QD4a4?t=85)

I forgot to tell you, I'm colorblind, don't be mad at my drawings ;)
