I'm Ivan Ivanchuck(Russian: *Иван Иванчук*), aspiring software developer.

Well, as a **software developer**, I **have to write code**, and I [write](https://github.com/l3r8yJ). As you can see I write preferably in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), sometimes in [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)), [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP). Also in [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)), but so far my knowledge is too small to say that I am a Rust programmer.

<br/>

I study at the university. I'm majoring in software engineering. I would not say that the knowledge I'm getting here is in any way relevant, but that's a topic for a separate conversation.

Why l3r8y? It's just leroy, but it's rough, why leroy? 
I find [this old video funny](https://youtu.be/mLyOj_QD4a4?t=85)

I forgot to tell you, I'm colorblind, don't be mad at my drawings ;)
