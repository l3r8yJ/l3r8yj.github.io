Today I simply want to share my experience of well-organized teamwork. 
I think it's an optimal and well-balanced way of management between business 
[scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))
or
[agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
pressure and team comfort in development. You might hear before about [docs as code](https://docs-as-co.de/) practice? 
I'm here to share my experience with this approach in production.

So, before we started, I wanted to tell about our team configuration:
Tech Lead, Project Owner, Project Manager, Business Analyst,
Two System Analysts, Two manual QA, Two Frontend Developers and One Backend Developer.
In our company, we have to use agile, scrum, etc.
