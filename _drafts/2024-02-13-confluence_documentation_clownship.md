How often you have been annoyed by crappy written documentation
in [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)?
All these infinite wiki-pages with level of nesting at least 20?
Maybe you can remember finding two pages on the same topic that contradict each other?
It is even better when your codebase matches with confluence wiki only 10â€“20%
of the actual codebase state.
So, how can we avoid these issues?
Or when analytics guys never heard about **formatting** before?

# Solution

First of all, all that you need it is to put all of your documentation into a separate repository.
