I don't know why, but for some reason I've been asked many times in the last couple of months how to get started in software development. To be honest I'm not even close to understanding why this happens, I'm not some kind of cool or famous developer, but for some reason people try to ask me this question. Well, this post is dedicated to those who will be asking me in the future.  I'm just tired of saying the same thing over and over again.

Buddy, there's one thing you need to know to get started. It's **that programming should be fun AF for you!**

If you're still wondering if you should start, or if you don't think it's the right thing for you, then find something else to focus on. You'll just freak out while you're pushing yourself to do it.

I am usually asked by novice Java programmers, so I will orient myself to them in this post.

## Sources of knowledge

I prefer books to other sources of information. You don't need to read books about the Sptring framework, Hibernate, etc. 
You need to read books that will deal with general aspects of software development. 
Such books will never lose relevance, unlike those books that are designed for a specific framework. 
By the time a book dedicated to the framework comes out, it will have had time to be updated several times.

There are several books that i like

- General
  - [Junior Objects](https://www.yegor256.com/junior-objects.html) this book will make you a real software developer, as long as you complete all the exercises. There are many other very useful books hidden inside this book.

  - [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Robert-Martin-Craftsmanship/dp/B08LF126HT) This book is like the Bible for programmers. Just read it.

  - [Code Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete) You know what, programmers have several Bibles :)

  - [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) You know what, programmers have several Bibles :) 

  - [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052) A lot of useful stuff, especially about testing.

  - [Elegant Objects, v1-v2](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html) Watch out! May cause a burning pain in the ass of people with an intolerant opinion different from that of the majority. 
  These books will break down your understanding of OOP. 
  **To me**, these concepts are more properly described than what we are used to hearing.

  - [Head First Java](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-java/9781492091646/) this book was my first, and honestly, it is one of the best books to start learning Java.

  - [Effective Java](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/) Guide how to use Java in the "right" way.
