Now I can see the dependencies for my project taking about 15 minutes to load. While they are loading, I think about what does higher education give me?

This is a rather controversial topic of discussion. On the one hand, we hear that this education is a base, a foundation for future knowledge; on the other hand, there is an opinion that it is useless.

*Important mention, I study at a regional university and I guess that in the best universities the situation is a little different, for the better*

## Higher education is important, right?

Let's take a look at three guys. 

  1. The first one is a regular guy who doesn't know what he wants. Just goes after what his parents told him to do, or they just bought the education, for example, or he just doesn't want to get into the army and the only legal way to do that is to get a higher degree. Yes, for you the army may sound kind of silly, but in some countries it is a pressing problem. He was never interested in programming, etc. What do you think is the level of such a person's interest in learning and researching the subject? What is the motivation?    *(80% of the total number of students)*
  2. The second was a guy who had never written a program before, but for some reason he liked it in his first year. He enjoys doing labs, taking exams and going to lectures, and getting a scholarship. All in all, he studies diligently. Things are a little bit better here, but as a rule such students very rarely do anything outside the university. *(18% of the total number of students)*
  3. The third guy found himself in programming at a young age, maybe as a kid, maybe as a teenager (13-16 years old). It's not that important. He already knows what he wants to do in the next few years. Often such students get a job in the 1st or 2nd year of university. *(1-2% of the total number of students)*

*All percentages are approximate, I took them from my own experience*

So at this point we have three "types" of students. Let's think about what the university has to offer each of them. 

For the first type, it's just what he "have to do". Another annoying thing in his life.

It is useless to force someone who doesn't want to learn, the knowledge will simply fly out of his head in a second.
